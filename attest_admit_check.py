A program that takes as input a file containing the access logs as sent to SEAS and FAS Science, and extracts those
accesses and checks to see if those who are entering have taken the required training and have
self-attested to having no COVID-19 symptoms.

The program assumes that a csv file containing a dictionary from huid->interval records (as defined in
interval_rec.py) for those who have self-attested to no symptoms, and a csv file containing the set of HUIDs that have
completed training that allows return to campus. These need to be in filescalled attest_d.csv and trained_set.csv,
respectively.

The program produces three files:

SuspectAccess.csv, a listing of the huid, name, building, data and time of access, and whether or not they have taken
 training, for those accessing the building who are not on the authorized for access.

AllowedAccess.csv, a listing like the above but of those who are authorized for the access

BuildingAccess.csv, a listing of each building accessed and the number of times it was accessed

Each of these can be read into a spreadsheet, which allows sorting and visual displays of various kinds.

There is also an option to have a file called grey_set.pkl, a pickle file for a set of HUIDs. The HUIDs in this set will
be seen as allowed, but will be written out in a file called grey_access.csv. This allows exclusion of arbitrary
persons from the requirements of the training and self-attestation.
