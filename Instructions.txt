The program process_access_list.py takes as input a file containing the access logs as sent to SEAS and FAS Science, and
extracts thoseaccess that are at the periphery (determined by looking at the name of the card unit and seeing if it
contains either "Entry" or "Exterior") and checks to see if those who are entering are on the allowed list supplied by
the Deans.

The program will filter out custodians and security people. It will also filter out hourly and part-time tradespeople.

The program assumes that a pickle file containing a dictionary from huid->employee records (as defined in
employee_rec.py) and a pickle file containing the set of HUIDs that are allowed into the buildings are in the same
directory in which the program is run; these need to be called uid_dict.pkl and allowed_set.pkl, respectively.
to run the program, type in a terminal window

python process_access_list.py name_of_building_access_file.csv

The input file should be in .csv format; this may require exporting from a spreadsheet format (like .xlsx using the
'save as' option and picking .csv file as the format).

The program produces three files:

SuspectAccess.csv, a listing of the huid, name, building, data and time of access for those accessing the building who
are not on the authorized access list

AllowedAccess.csv, a listing like the above but of those who are on the authorized access list

BuildingAccess.csv, a listing of each building accessed and the number of times it was accessed

Each of these can be read into a spreadsheet, which allows sorting and visual displays of various kinds.
