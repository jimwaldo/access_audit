The program process_access_list.py takes as input a file containing the access logs as sent to SEAS and FAS Science, and
 checks to see if those who are entering are on the allowed list supplied by the Deans or on a "grey" list kept to
 cover those who have other reasons to enter the buildings (such as custodians, security, and trades people).

The program assumes that a pickle file containing the set of HUIDs that are allowed into the buildings, with the name
"allowed_set.pkl", and a pickle file containing the set of HUIDs for custodians, security, staff and others allowed,
with the name "grey_set.pkl", are in the same
directory in which the program is run. These files can be generated by running

python allowed_set.py name_of_input.csv name_of_output.pkl

where name_of_input.csv names a file in which the HUID of the allowed person is in the fourth position of each line of
the file. The resulting file will be a python pickle file. If no output file is given, the output will be named
allowd_set.pkl; note that this will overwrite any file with that name in the directory in which the program is run.

To run the program, type (in a terminal window)

python process_access_list.py name_of_building_access_file.csv

The input file should be in .csv format; this may require exporting from a spreadsheet format (like .xlsx using the
'save as' option and picking .csv file as the format).

The program produces four files:

SuspectAccess.csv, a listing of the huid, name, building, data and time of access for those accessing the building who
are not in one of the authorized access sets

GreyAccess.csv, a listing of huid, name, building, date, and time of access for those accessing the building who are in
the grey_set.pkl file

AllowedAccess.csv, a listing like the above but of those who are on the authorized access list allowed_set.pkl

BuildingAccess.csv, a listing of each building accessed and the number of times it was accessed

Each of these can be read into a spreadsheet, which allows sorting and visual displays of various kinds.
